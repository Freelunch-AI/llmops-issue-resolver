# Sandbox SDK

The Sandbox SDK is a comprehensive toolkit that provides developers with the necessary tools and interfaces to interact with the sandbox environment for LLM operations. This SDK serves as the primary interface between client applications and the sandbox infrastructure, facilitating seamless integration with both the Sandbox Gateway and Sandbox Orchestrator components.

## Overview

The Sandbox SDK abstracts the complexity of sandbox operations, providing a clean and intuitive API for:
- Managing sandbox environments
- Executing LLM experiments
- Collecting and analyzing results
- Monitoring sandbox resources
- Handling security and access control

## Main Features

- **Environment Management**: Create, configure, and manage isolated sandbox environments
- **Experiment Execution**: Run and control LLM experiments in a controlled setting
- **Resource Monitoring**: Track resource usage and performance metrics
- **Security Controls**: Implement access control and security policies
- **Results Collection**: Gather and process experiment results
- **Integration Support**: Seamless integration with other sandbox components

## Architecture

The SDK is designed to work in conjunction with two main components:

### Sandbox Gateway Integration
- Handles communication with the gateway service
- Manages authentication and authorization
- Routes requests to appropriate sandbox instances
- Implements retry and error handling mechanisms

### Sandbox Orchestrator Integration
- Coordinates resource allocation
- Manages experiment lifecycle
- Handles scheduling and queuing
- Provides status monitoring and reporting

## Submodules

### `client/`
The core client implementation for interacting with sandbox services.

### `auth/`
Authentication and authorization utilities for secure sandbox access.

### `config/`
Configuration management and environment setup tools.

### `models/`
Data models and schema definitions for sandbox operations.

### `utils/`
Common utilities and helper functions used across the SDK.

### `monitoring/`
Tools for tracking and reporting sandbox metrics.

## Installation

```bash
pip install sandbox-sdk
```

## Usage

Basic usage example:

```python
from sandbox_sdk import SandboxClient

# Initialize the client
client = SandboxClient(config_path="config.yaml")

# Create a sandbox environment
sandbox = client.create_environment()

# Run an experiment
experiment = sandbox.run_experiment(
    model="gpt-3",
    prompt="Hello, world!",
    parameters={"temperature": 0.7}
)

# Get results
results = experiment.get_results()
```

## Configuration

The SDK can be configured using either:
- YAML configuration file
- Environment variables
- Programmatic configuration

## Error Handling

The SDK implements comprehensive error handling for:
- Network issues
- Authentication failures
- Resource constraints
- Invalid operations
